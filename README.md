# Vision Metrics - Digitizing the measurements of Analog Gauge Meters.

## Computing the Metrics of Multidisciplinary Analog Gauges Using Computer Vision

### Project Overview:
• This project focuses on developing a comprehensive system to automate the reading of multidisciplinary analog gauges using advanced computer vision techniques. By leveraging the capabilities of OpenCV, we aim to address the inefficiencies and inaccuracies associated with manual meter readings and contribute to the modernization of monitoring systems in diverse industrial settings.

• The motivation behind this project lies in the need for efficiency, accuracy, and automation in various industries where analog meters are still prevalent. Manual recording of analog meter readings can be time-consuming and prone to errors, which can have significant consequences in critical systems. Our solution aims to digitize these readings, improving accuracy, enabling real-time monitoring, and integrating with data analysis pipelines for enhanced insights and decision-making.


### Key Steps:

• Image Capture: Utilize cameras to capture real-time images of analog meters.

•Image Processing: Employ OpenCV to process the captured images, identifying dial zones, extracting scale readings, and locating pointer positions.

• Reading Extraction: Use algorithms to interpret the meter readings from the processed images.

• Web Application: Develop a web interface using Flask to display the digitized meter readings.

• Alert System: Enable continuous, real-time monitoring and alerts for anomalies.


###Benefits:

• Efficiency: Automates the meter reading process, saving time and reducing human errors.

• Accuracy: Improves the accuracy of readings by eliminating manual interpretation.

• Real-time Monitoring: Allows for continuous monitoring and instant anomaly detection.

• Data Integration: Facilitates seamless integration with existing data analysis systems.

• Scalability: Adapts to various types of analog meters, enhancing its applicability across different industries.
